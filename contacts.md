Generally I don't feel like chatting with random strangers from internet. So I have somewhat of a "only if I know you personally" policy and in such case you _would_ be able to find me in [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), Facebook and Google's Hangout. Of them all I do prefer Signal.

As everyone my age I used to frequent Skype, ICQ and IRC. But not much any more so chances are slim you would find me there. You know what? I will give you my ICQ number, just for the kicks - 222892277. Just to prove I still remember it!

### But I really need to contact you!

Well, if you are *that* desperate! Then you would be able to lookup the contact information for this domain, wouldn't you?
