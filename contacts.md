Generally I don't feel like chatting with random strangers from the internet. So I have somewhat of a "only if I know you personally" policy. In such case you will be able to find me in [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). Of them all I do prefer Signal and hate Viber the most.

As everyone my age I used to frequent Skype, ICQ and IRC. But not much any more so chances are slim you will find me there. Two out of the three are gone alredy. IRC will live forever, it seems, but even I don't get any usage out of it.

You will not find me on platforms implicitly designed to spy on me. Or it is explicit at this point, I don't know. So Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and the likes are out.

### But I really need to contact you!

You could DM me on Reddit, I guess.
